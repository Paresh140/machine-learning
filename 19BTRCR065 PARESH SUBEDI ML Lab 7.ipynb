    "\n",
    "- We have a finite number of ingredients required to make any meal and are considered to be our **States**\n",
    "- There are the finite possible products for each ingredient and are therefore the **Actions of each state**\n",

    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo learning takes the combined the quality of each step towards reaching an end goal and requires that, in order to assess the quality of any step, we must wait and see the outcome of the whole combination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo is often avoided due to the time required to go through the whole process before being able to learn. However, in our problem it is required as our final check when establishing whether the combination of products selected is good or bad is to add up the real cost of those selected and check whether or not this is below or above our budget. Futhermore, at least at this stage, we will not be considering more than a few ingredients and so the time taken is not significant in this regard.\n",

A factor of 0 makes the agent learn nothing, while a factor of 1 makes the agent consider only the most recent information.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning)"
